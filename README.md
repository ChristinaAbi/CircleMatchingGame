# CircleMatchingGame

/*
This is my first game fully created with HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery.

The technologies used in this simple memory game are github.

The approach taken to complete this game was a "thinking with the end in mind" approach. I worked backwards, starting with what I wanted the end function to be when it was ready to be launched. I wrote the jquery code and the functions without declaring them first. Then I worked my way back to what should have been the first step, which was creating the variables to place in the functions so that the game would function properly. This approach helped me better understand what I needed to do to reach that end goal.

Unsolved Problems

Some unsolved problems I faced were separating the properties applied to the back and front of the card, getting the computer to flip the card it randomly chose based on the cardArray, and getting the DOM to realize that the user has clicked two cards, simulating an entire turn.
